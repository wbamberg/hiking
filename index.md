## Close, 2WD accessible ##

These hikes/scrambles are all within a couple of hours drive of Vancouver and are 2WD accessible.

### Crown Mountain ###

One of three North Shore hikes. Access is from the bottom of Grouse Mountain, and I'd want to hike up, but ride the gondola back down. Like all the North Shore mountains, steep, difficult, and lots of time in the trees.

### Coliseum & Burwell ###

Also a North Shore one. I'd choose to go up the Seymour side rather than Lynn Valley, which means a 9K bike ride in along the [Seymour Valley Trailway](http://www.letsgobiking.net/2010/05/5-seymour-forest-north-vancouver-bc.html). We could even bike from home, but that would make it pretty tough. Like all the North Shore mountains, steep, difficult, and lots of time in the trees.

### Brunswick Mountain ###

The last North Shore one. The highest of the North Shore mountains.

### Mount Price ###

This is the mountain on the other side of Garibaldi Lake from Panorama Ridge. Pluses: great views of the lake and surrounding mountains. Minuses: hiking up from the trailhead to Garibaldi Lake is boring and v crowded. Very long, but (I think) not too difficult.

### Tomyhoi/Yellow Aster Butte ###

In Washington. I think actually getting to the top of Tomyhoi would be too difficult, but getting close should be possible. Alternatively, Yellow Aster Butte is in the same area and is supposed to be nice. It's supposed to have great fall colours, so maybe a good choice for September?

There are lots of other great trails round there that could be worth a look.

### Brandywine Mountain ###

Great hike. I've been here twice and failed to get to the top both times.

### Sigurd Peak ###

Up the Squamish River valley, great views of the Tantalus range. Looks like a very steep hike, difficult. It would be good to camp at the cabin the night before so as to get an early start.

### Gentian Peak ###

This is a bit exploratory. It's the next mountain along from Panorama Ridge, above Garibaldi Lake. Access is from [Helm Lake](http://www.livetrails.com/trails/Helm-Lake-17.html). I think I know the way there, but there's no trail. Fun! Ultimately I'd like to hike Castle Towers, but that can't be done in a day.

### Needle Peak ###

This is in the Coquihalla, and is the furthest from Vancouver. It's probably 2 1/4 hours drive from Van. It's supposed to be really nice, but in general I usually like the Coast mountains better than the Coquihalla.

## Far away, 2WD accessible ##

These hikes are all far enough from Vancouver (about 3 hours drive or more) to be not really easily doable in a day. Somehow we'd need to figure out a place to stay the night beforehand.

They all look really amazing though.

### Locomotive Mountain ###

From Semaphore Lakes, up the Hurley FSR. Semaphore Lakes is a really beautiful area, and Locomotive looks like a great mountain.
