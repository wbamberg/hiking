## Close, 2WD accessible ##

### Crown Mountain ###

One of three North Shore hikes. Access is from the bottom of Grouse Mountain, and I'd want to hike up, but ride the gondola back down. Like all the North Shore mountains, steep, difficult, and lots of time in the trees.

### Coliseum/Burwell ###

Also a North Shore one. I'd choose to go up the Seymour side rather than Lynn Valley, which means a 9K bike ride in along the [Seymour Valley Trailway](http://www.letsgobiking.net/2010/05/5-seymour-forest-north-vancouver-bc.html). We could even bike from home, but that would make it pretty tough. Like all the North Shore mountains, steep, difficult, and lots of time in the trees.

### Brunswick Mountain ###

The last North Shore one. The highest of the North Shore mountains.

### Mount Price ###

This is the mountain on the other side of Garibaldi Lake from Panorama Ridge. Pluses: great views of the lake and surrounding mountains. Minuses: hiking up from the trailhead to Garibaldi Lake is boring and v crowded. Very long, but (I think) not too difficult.

### Tomyhoi/Yellow Aster Butte ###

Mountain in Washington. I think actually getting to the top of Tomyhoi would be too difficult, but getting close should be possible. Alternatively, Yellow Aster Butte is in the same area and is supposed to be nice.

Usually there's still snow in the alpine in June. This can mean a couple of things: (1) it's less enjoyable tramping through rotten snow than solid ground, and (2) for some hikes you might need additional safety equipment (ice axe and crampons) in the snow than you would otherwise.

This winter there's been much less snow than usual, so most hikes will probably be snow-free, even in the alpine. But a lot still depends on what happens with the weather in May and June: if it warms up, the snow melts fast, but otherwise it can hang around.

So, check what the snow conditions are like for the hike you're considering.

### Transportation ###

* Most trailheads are not easily accessible by public transit.
* Only a few trailheads are easily accessible on paved roads: many require you to drive on an unpaved gravel or dirt road.

Many rental car contracts specifically forbid you from driving the car on unpaved roads.

So your options include:

* limiting your choices to easily-accessible hikes
* walking/biking further, to get to the trailhead
* getting a local to drive you to places

This also means that easily-accessible trails tend to be very much more crowded.

Also, "unpaved road" can mean anything from a road that's totally drivable in a normal 2WD car, to one that requires a serious 4WD truck type of thing. All the hikes I've listed below are generally accessible in a 2WD car, but the condition of any given road might vary too, depending on how much maintenance it has had lately and what the weather's been doing.

### Water ###

Make sure you have enough. Especially on a hot day above the treeline, you need it. YMMV, but for a long hike in summer, I take 3 litres. Depending on the hike and the snow conditions, you can usually fill up somewhere on the way, but you may risk catching giardia unless you treat the water.

## Some ideas ##

Here are a few hikes I've done, that I like and that are within reach of Whistler. It's hard to judge "difficulty", since that's so subjective. But I'd say that the first two are the easiest, and they are both hikes which I think anyone who's not a total stranger to physical activity could enjoy (although of course it's still necessary to have proper boots/clothes/water/food/etc). The rest are all more demanding. Only one (Brandywine) is rough/steep enough to be considered scrambling rather than hiking. All distances are there-and-back.

### Joffre Lakes ###

[http://trailpeak.com/index.jsp?con=trail&val=178](http://trailpeak.com/index.jsp?con=trail&val=178)

Easy hike that links up three beautiful turquoise lakes. The top lake is tucked in an alpine bowl with a glacier. If you have the time, energy, and skills, you can continue from there to climb one of the mountains above it.

It's 11K with about 400 metres elevation gain. It used to be a bit of a rough trail, but it's been "improved" recently. I haven't been since it was improved.

#### Pros: ####

* pretty easy hike, and nice lakes
* paved road access

#### Cons: ####

* very popular
* while the lakes are lovely, you'll see more spectacular views on other hikes

### Elfin Lakes ###

[http://trailpeak.com/index.jsp?con=trail&val=173](http://trailpeak.com/index.jsp?con=trail&val=173)

[https://www.flickr.com/photos/will_and_andrea/sets/72157635505967148/](https://www.flickr.com/photos/will_and_andrea/sets/72157635505967148/)

This is one of the most popular hikes in the area. You need to drive 16K up a dirt road from Squamish, then it's a boring hike up for about an hour through the trees. After that you're walking along a ridge to a pair of small lakes, a hut, and a campsite. If you have time and energy there are some extra places you can visit from this point. Then turn around and come back the same way

It's about 22K, but only about 500 metres elevation gain.

#### Pros: ####
* pretty gentle hike, but really great views from once you get out of the trees. In terms of payoff for the amount of effort you put in, it's a very good option.

#### Cons: ####
* really busy at weekends
* no paved road access
* a fair distance from Whistler (more than an hour's drive)

### Musical Bumps/Russet Lake/Singing Pass ###

[http://trailpeak.com/index.jsp?con=trail&val=3311](http://trailpeak.com/index.jsp?con=trail&val=3311)

[https://www.flickr.com/photos/will_and_andrea/sets/72157624772401565/](https://www.flickr.com/photos/will_and_andrea/sets/72157624772401565/)

You start from Whistler village. Hike up the Singing Pass trail (maybe 2-3 hours of pretty boring, gradual ascent through the forest), get out of the trees at Singing Pass, keep going up until you get to Russet Lake, then back down to Singing Pass, then back over a series of minor summits called the Musical Bumps, ending up a the top of Whistler Mountain, whence you can ride the gondola back down to the village. Or, you can do it in reverse, riding up the gondola to the top of Whistler Mountain, and hiking back down Singing Pass trail.

It's long (maybe 28K), with substantial cumulative elevation gain (maybe 1500 metres or more) but not terribly steep at any point. From Singing Pass on you have great views all the way, and tons of wildflowers at the right time of year.

#### Pros: ####
* access right from Whistler Village, no transportation worries
* apart from the first part to Singing Pass, you have great views all the way, and tons of wildflowers at the right time of year
* it's a loop, with not much need to retrace your steps

#### Cons: ####
* can get pretty crowded
* if you are planning to come down the gondola, you must make sure you can get there before it stops for the night

### Brandywine Mountain ###

[http://www.trailpeak.com/trail-Brandywine-Mountain-near-Whistler-BC-527](http://www.trailpeak.com/trail-Brandywine-Mountain-near-Whistler-BC-527)

[https://www.flickr.com/photos/will_and_andrea/sets/72157631033989550/](https://www.flickr.com/photos/will_and_andrea/sets/72157631033989550/)

The trail gains 500m, steeply, through trees, then you pop out in a little subalpine valley. Keep going to near the end of the valley, then head up the left-hand side over heather and then talus and/or snow. It gets pretty steep in this bit. Eventually you top out on to a ridge that you can follow to the summit.

It's about 12K, but gains probably around 1500 metres. If you have 4WD, and depending on the road condition, you can drive almost up to the valley, saving a bunch of effort.

Parts of this trip are steep and considered a scramble rather than a hike. If the steep bits are covered in snow, you might need an ice axe to get up them safely. Also, you don't have a trail for some of the time, so you need to figure out the route.

#### Pros: ####
* get to the top of a mountain
* great views, interesting terrain

#### Cons: ####
* no paved road access, and can be a bit tricky navigating the unpaved roads to the trailhead
* need to be happy with routefinding and steepness

### Panorama Ridge (Rubble Creek there and back) ###

[http://trailpeak.com/index.jsp?con=trail&val=537](http://trailpeak.com/index.jsp?con=trail&val=537)

This hike starts and ends at the Rubble Creek trailhead, just off the Sea to Sky highway. First you slog up 6K of switchbacks, then out into some wide-open meadows, covered with wildflowers in season. There are various places you can go from here, but maybe the best option is up Panorama Ridge, which overlooks Garibaldi Lake. The views are really amazing. Then head back the way you came.

It's about 30K there and back, with about 1500 metres elevation gain. Long - it took us 10 hours - but easy trails almost all the way (the last part up Panorama Ridge is a bit rough).

#### Pros: ####
* really amazing views from the top
* subalpine meadows! wildflowers!
* paved road access

#### Cons: ####
* really busy
* very long
* the first 2 hours up through the trees is really boring

### Panorama Ridge (Cheakamus-Rubble Creek traverse) ###

[http://trailpeak.com/index.jsp?con=trail&val=784](http://trailpeak.com/index.jsp?con=trail&val=784) - although this description omits the detour up Panorama Ridge, which adds 5K or so distance and 500 metres or so elevation gain - but it's worth it.

[https://www.flickr.com/photos/will_and_andrea/sets/72157631162069884/](https://www.flickr.com/photos/will_and_andrea/sets/72157631162069884/)

This is a traverse from the Cheakamus Lake trailhead to the Rubble Creek trailhead, making a detour up Panorama Ridge on the way. The first half goes up Panorama Ridge from the Cheakamus Lake trailhead. The second half is the same as the return leg of the previous hike, back down to the Rubble Creek trailhead.

In terms of effort, it's probably about the same as the Rubble Creek there-and-back version: 30K distance, 1500 metres elevation. But it's a much better hike: the Cheakamus side is much less busy and is more interesting than the Rubble Creek side, you get really varied terrain and scenery, don't have to retrace your steps, and have all the same amazing views. This is one of my absolute favourite dayhikes here.

#### Pros: ####
* for the first half, this is much less busy than the previous hike. For the second half, it's just as busy but you will be too tired to care :)
* amazing views, lots of variety

#### Cons: ####
* no paved road access on the Cheakamus side
* complicated to set up: you need 2 cars, both of which can drive on unpaved roads, and you need to set up a shuttle, which adds time on to an already long day
